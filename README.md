# Learn Python
This repository contains the code and documentation on my learning journey. The idea is to craete directroy for each chapter as and when I learn Python. This README file will be updated as and when I create a new directory/chapter. 

Chapter1 - Python Basics


## How to Run the code.
Install python 3.9 or higher version on the system where you want to run the code.

`python3 --version` gives the python version installed.
